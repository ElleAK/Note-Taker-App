Note Taker App

This app lets you write, save, and delete notes. When the link to the notes page is clicked I am provided with a list of saved notes on the left and the ablility to write a new note. When I enter a new note with a new title the save icon appears and I am able to save that note. When I click on the trash icon the note is deleted.
